## Improving short read assemblies for comparative genomic insights in *Moorena bouillonii*
### Abstract

The cyanobacterium *Moorena bouillonii* is known to be a prolific producer of natural products. More can be learned about the chemical diversity that it has the potential to produce by studying the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) present in its genome. Long-read sequencing of a *M. bouillonii* culture from Papua New Guinea, followed by de novo assembly with Flye yielded the first complete genome for the species. Short-read sequences of nineteen potential *M. bouillonii* samples were assembled and iteratively scaffolded using a newly developed bioinformatics software called **iTerator**. iTerator significantly improved draft genome contiguity and BGC completeness. Biosynthetic diversity analyses revealed that *M. bouillonii* chemodiversity appears, from a genomic perspective, to be more highly concentrated in non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthetase (PKS) pathways, than in terpene and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) pathways.
