## *Moorena bouillonii* Chemogeography: Distributional Patterns of Compounds and Compound Families at Multiple Spatial Scales
### Abstract

Geographic location of collection is a factor known to be associated with chemodiversity in the cyanobacterium *Moorena bouillonii*. However, *M. bouillonii* chemogeography, and chemogeography in general, is understudied. Forty-nine collaboratively-sourced potential *M. bouillonii* crude extracts were profiled via liquid chromatography â€“ tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The resultant dataset was assessed for patterns in molecular features in aggregate, as well as distributional patterns of known molecular families. Comparative analyses were facilitated via **expansion of the Objective Relational Comparative Analyses (ORCA) pipeline**, with new tools for quantifying and visualizing varied conceptualizations of similarity across samples. These analyses revealed that both shrimp-association and location of origin influenced chemical composition, but chemogeographic relationships were no longer evident when examined at intra-island scale. Compound families exhibited unique distributions, with some tending towards more regional specificity. Mining of the rich metabolomics dataset yielded a list of priority molecular features for future natural products discovery efforts in M. bouillonii.
