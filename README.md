## Personal Explorations

### Predicting Cannabis Effects via Smell
#### supervised learning | classification | probablistic imputation | cross-validation | hyperparamater tuning 
Cannabis produces a plethora of interesting chemical compounds, many of which are thought to act synergistically in producing the pharamcological effects associated with specific strains. Classifiers built with sci-kit learn can be used to predict the effects of cannabis strains, using their aromas and flavors as proxies for terpene composition.
